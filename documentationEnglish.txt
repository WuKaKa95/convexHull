The programme is using a lightly modified Jarvis Algorithm, which first chooses an edge point, and then chooses next points in a way that would make the new side of the hull create the biggest possible angle with the last created side.

The programme takes is an information about the quantity of the points and their respective positions, and returns the points of which a Convex Hull surrounding all the other elements consists of, starting with the forst chosen point and continuing with a counter-clockwise order.

To calculate the angle between respective vectors, the programme uses a mathematical formula: arccos(A/B*C) where A is the dot product of the two vectors creating an angle, and B and C are their respective lenghts. The result is multiplied by (180/pi), to get a result in degrees.

Used libraries:
<cmath> - to handle mathematical equations
<vector> - to handel simple dynamic arrays
<array> - to handle arrays that are passed to functions and added as rows to the dynamic array
<fstream> to handle work with "enter" and "out" .txt files, for easier input and output of data
